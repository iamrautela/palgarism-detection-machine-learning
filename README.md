🧠 Plagiarism Detector using Machine Learning
A Flask-based Web App to Identify Copied Content

Plagiarism detection is a critical task in both academic and professional environments. This project leverages machine learning to build a robust plagiarism detector capable of identifying copied or paraphrased text with impressive accuracy.

The goal is simple: turn raw text comparison into intelligent analysis — and make it accessible through a clean, user-friendly Flask web interface.

🚀 Key Features

**🧾 Input two text documents and get an instant plagiarism score <br>
🔍 Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction <br>
🧠 Employs Logistic Regression for similarity classification <br>
💡 Modular and easy to extend with advanced NLP models <br>
🌐 Flask-powered web interface for convenient usage<br>**

🧩 Project Workflow <br>
1️⃣ Collecting the Dataset

The first step is to gather a diverse dataset containing both original and plagiarized text pairs.
You can:

1. Download open-source plagiarism datasets from Kaggle or similar repositories, or
2. Generate your own dataset by paraphrasing or modifying existing documents.
3. Each record in the dataset contains:
Original text
Plagiarized text
Label indicating the plagiarism status

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

To prepare text data for modeling, we clean and standardize it through:

**Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens
Lowercasing: Ensuring uniform case for all words
Removing punctuation: Eliminating unnecessary symbols
Stopword removal: Filtering out common words (like and, the, is) that add little meaning**

These steps make the model focus on meaningful linguistic patterns.

3️⃣ Building the Machine Learning Model

We transform text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization, which captures how important each word is within a document relative to the entire dataset.
Then, we train a Logistic Regression classifier that learns to distinguish between original and plagiarized pairs based on these features.
You can replace Logistic Regression with other models like:
**Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Deep Learning (LSTM/BERT) for advanced accuracy**

4️⃣ Flask Web Application

To make the system user-friendly, we wrap the model in a Flask web application.

The app allows users to:
Input two text documents
Click “Check Plagiarism”
Instantly view the plagiarism percentage or similarity score

The backend handles model inference and displays the results on a sleek, minimal UI.
